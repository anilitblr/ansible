= ldap-freeipa.py

Ansible dynamic inventory script for FreeIPA.  Tested using FreeIPA 4.4.

== Description

This script performs a LDAP simple bind against a FreeIPA server using a
low-privilege service user, and collects information about registered 
hosts and hostgroups and maps those directly into the Ansible inventory.

Unlike the freeipa.py script currently in the upstream contrib repository 
(https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/devel/contrib/inventory), this
script does not require a Kerberos credential or use the FreeIPA API.

== Getting Started

The script will need to be edited before it is used.  You will need to 
know

* The LDAP URL for your FreeIPA server (for example, ldap://your-ipa-server.example.com)
* The BaseDN of your FreeIPA server
* The DN and password for your service user
